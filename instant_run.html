			<p>
			The project started out of frustration of using other solutions like <span class=app-name>Power Toys Run</span> or just the <span class=app-name>Start menu search</span> in Windows.
			</p>

			<p>
			The former was getting too slow and unresposive especially when the power mode of my laptop was set to battery saver.
			</p>

			<p>
			Whilst the latter was an okay option, the annoyance of having to deal with it launching <span class=app-name>Microsoft Edge</span> the moment I misspelled the search query, outweighted all the benefits of it for me.
			</p>

			<br>

			<p style="font-style: italic" class=note>
			* Besides that, it was also an excuse for me to finally try writing my own UI from scratch, even if it is very minimalistic and limited ...
			</p>

			<br>

			<p>
			Although majority of the project was written from scratch, it still relies on 3 libraries: <span class=lib-name>stb_truetype</span>, <span class=lib-name>stb_image</span> and <span class=lib-name>glad</span>.
			</p>

			<p>
			One of the main goals of the project was to make the searching be resposive, that is why it is done on every keystroke.
